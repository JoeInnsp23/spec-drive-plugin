# What we're building and why
summary: |
  Brief description of what this spec covers and the business value.

# Requirements (WHAT, not HOW)
requirements:
  user-stories:
    - "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"

  acceptance-criteria:
    - "[NEEDS CLARIFICATION] Criterion with forced clarification"
    - "Clear, testable criterion"

  non-functional:
    - "Performance: Response time < 200ms"
    - "Security: HTTPS required"

# Completeness checklist (Gate 1: Simplicity)
completeness:
  - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remaining
  - [ ] All requirements testable
  - [ ] Success criteria measurable

# Design considerations (constraints, dependencies)
design:
  constraints:
    - "Must work with existing auth system"

  dependencies:
    - "Requires SPEC-YYY to be complete"

  risks:
    - "Risk: Performance impact on large datasets"
      mitigation: "Use pagination and caching"
